### Contents of this repository

This repository contains Quarto (.qmd) files with the text of the book "UN Handbook on Remote Sensing for Agricultural Statistics". 

This book is a practical guide that enables for using remote sensing for agricultural statistics.  It provides readers with the means of producing high-quality maps of agricutural areas and prediction of crop yields. Our main target audience are national statistical authorities which are interested in improving their surveys and census using Earth observations (EO). We aim to foster a collaborative environment where they can use EO data to enhance their national land use and cover estimates, supporting sustainable development policies.
