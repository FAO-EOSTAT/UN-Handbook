## Introduction and Key Concepts

Agricultural disaster response plays a critical role in ensuring global
food security, stabilizing rural economies, and promoting sustainable
agricultural development. As agriculture remains the primary livelihood
for a significant portion of the world's population---particularly in
disaster-prone and resource-limited regions---effective response
mechanisms are essential to minimize the adverse impacts of natural and
biological hazards. Timely and coordinated disaster response not only
facilitates the rapid restoration of agricultural production but also
provides vital information for national policy-making, risk reduction
strategies, and long-term resilience-building efforts. Thus, advancing
research in agricultural disaster response is of profound significance
for achieving the goals of poverty alleviation, climate adaptation, and
food system resilience amid increasing global uncertainties.

In this context, remote sensing has become a powerful tool for
post-disaster evaluations, offering rapid, consistent, and large-scale
observations of affected areas. Its capacity to deliver objective and
up-to-date spatial information enables governments, humanitarian
agencies, and decision-makers to assess damage, estimate losses, and
prioritize interventions with greater efficiency and accuracy.

Agricultural disasters are diverse in nature and include droughts,
floods, tropical storms, pest outbreaks, and wildfires. Each type of
disaster presents unique challenges for impact evaluations, resource
deployment, and recovery planning. A clear understanding of these hazard
types is essential for designing responsive and context-specific
evaluations frameworks.

Furthermore, it is important to establish a shared understanding of core
terminology---such as *disaster*, *damage*, *loss*, and *impact*---and
to situate the "response" phase within the broader disaster management
cycle, which also includes mitigation, preparedness, and recovery. This
conceptual clarity supports effective coordination among stakeholders
and enhances the quality and comparability of disaster data.

This chapter lays the groundwork for the report by introducing the
purpose, tools, and key concepts of agricultural disaster response. It
establishes a unified vocabulary and analytical framework for the
technical discussions and methods presented in subsequent chapters.

### Purpose of Agricultural Disaster Response

Agricultural disaster response serves as a critical component of broader
disaster management systems, aiming to mitigate the adverse impacts of
natural hazards on agricultural systems and rural livelihoods. The
overarching purpose of such response efforts can be distilled into three
interrelated goals: safeguarding food security, facilitating the
recovery of agricultural production, and supporting evidence-based
policy-making.

First, ensuring food security is the most immediate and pressing
objective of agricultural disaster response. Natural disasters such as
droughts, floods, storms, and pest outbreaks can severely disrupt crop
yields, livestock health, and supply chains, thereby threatening the
availability, accessibility, and stability of food. An effective
response strategy helps prevent food shortages, stabilize markets, and
protect vulnerable populations from falling into food insecurity or
malnutrition.

Second, agricultural disaster response is essential for the rapid
recovery and rehabilitation of production systems. Post-disaster
interventions---including damage evaluations, restoration of irrigation
infrastructure, distribution of seeds and agricultural inputs, and
technical assistance---enable farmers to resume planting and livestock
operations in a timely manner. These efforts help minimize long-term
economic losses and reduce the risk of secondary impacts such as rural
unemployment, land abandonment, and degradation of agroecosystems.

Third, agricultural disaster response provides critical data and
insights to inform policy-making processes at local, national, and
international levels. Accurate and timely information on disaster
impacts enables governments and humanitarian organizations to allocate
resources efficiently, design targeted aid programs, and strengthen risk
management frameworks. Moreover, lessons learned from past disaster
events contribute to the development of more resilient and adaptive
agricultural systems in the face of future climate-related threats.

In sum, agricultural disaster response is not only a reactive mechanism
but also a strategic pillar for sustaining agricultural livelihoods,
promoting rural resilience, and securing long-term food system stability
in disaster-prone regions.

### Role of Remote Sensing in Post-Disaster Evaluations

Remote sensing plays a pivotal role in post-disaster evaluations by
enabling timely, large-scale, and objective evaluations of disaster
impacts across agricultural landscapes. Unlike traditional ground-based
surveys, which are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
constrained by accessibility limitations in disaster-stricken areas,
remote sensing technologies offer a rapid and synoptic means of data
collection. This capability is particularly crucial in the aftermath of
large-scale natural hazards such as floods, droughts, cyclones,
wildfires, or pest outbreaks, where immediate information is essential
for effective response and recovery planning. As shown in @fig-image1-disaster,
after a disaster occurs, the ground operation and control station
promptly deploys agricultural satellites to capture images of the target
area and transmit them back to the ground, enabling safe and rapid
disaster evaluations and analysis over large areas.

```

Through the use of satellite imagery, aerial platforms, and unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), remote sensing allows for the continuous
monitoring of vegetation health, surface water dynamics, land cover
changes, and infrastructure damage. High temporal resolution enables
near-real-time tracking of evolving disaster conditions, while high
spatial and spectral resolution supports the detection of subtle changes
in crop vigor, soil moisture, and land surface temperature. These
observations facilitate the quantification of affected areas, the
classification of damage severity, and the identification of priority
zones for intervention.

Furthermore, the objectivity and consistency of remote sensing data
provide a scientifically grounded basis for post-disaster reporting and
decision-making. By integrating remote sensing outputs with geographic
information systems (GIS) and ground validation, stakeholders can
generate detailed impact maps and statistical estimates to inform
emergency relief allocation, guide rehabilitation efforts, and support
insurance claims or compensation mechanisms. In policy contexts, remote
sensing-derived evaluations also contribute to risk reduction
strategies, early warning systems, and the long-term development of
climate-resilient agricultural practices.

In sum, remote sensing enhances the efficiency, transparency, and
effectiveness of post-disaster evaluations, making it an indispensable
tool for agricultural disaster response and sustainable risk management.

### Major Types of Agriculture-Related Disasters

Agricultural systems are highly sensitive to a wide range of natural
hazards, many of which have intensified in frequency and severity due to
climate change and environmental degradation. Table 1 provides a
detailed list of the main types currently associated with agricultural
disasters. Among these, droughts, floods, storms, pest outbreaks, and
wildfires represent the most common and devastating types of disasters
that directly affect agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods.

**Table** **1 Main Types of Disasters Related to Agriculture**

Droughts are among the most widespread and insidious threats to
agriculture. Characterized by prolonged periods of below-average
precipitation, droughts reduce soil moisture, suppress crop growth,
deplete water resources for irrigation, and compromise pasture quality
for livestock. The slow-onset nature of drought makes it particularly
difficult to detect and manage in its early stages, often leading to
cumulative and long-lasting impacts on food production and ecosystem
health.

Floods, on the other hand, present a more sudden and often catastrophic
challenge. Resulting from excessive rainfall, river overflow, or poor
drainage infrastructure, floods can inundate farmlands, destroy standing
crops, erode fertile soil layers, and contaminate water sources. In
low-lying and coastal agricultural regions, repeated flooding events can
degrade arable land over time, making recovery increasingly difficult
without significant intervention.

Storms, including tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and severe convective
systems, pose multifaceted risks to agriculture. High winds and
torrential rain not only cause physical damage to crops and
infrastructure but also result in saltwater intrusion, increased soil
salinity, and delayed planting or harvesting activities. In regions
dependent on seasonal agricultural calendars, even short-term storm
disruptions can have lasting effects on yield and income stability.

Pest outbreaks---often triggered or exacerbated by climatic
anomalies---represent another major disaster type with severe
consequences for agriculture. Locust swarms, armyworms, and
crop-specific diseases can spread rapidly over large areas, destroying
vegetation and undermining food security. These biological hazards often
follow other climate-related events such as droughts or floods, taking
advantage of weakened crop resilience and disrupted ecological balances.

Wildfires, increasingly prevalent in both forested and agricultural
zones, pose a dual threat to farming communities. Not only can fires
directly destroy crops, pastureland, livestock, and infrastructure, but
the resulting air pollution and soil degradation can further hinder
recovery efforts. In regions characterized by dry climates and flammable
vegetation, even small ignition sources can escalate into uncontrollable
wildfires, especially under high-temperature and wind-driven conditions.

Together, these disaster types illustrate the vulnerability of
agriculture to a wide spectrum of environmental hazards. Understanding
their characteristics, triggers, and cascading effects is essential for
developing responsive strategies to protect food systems, sustain
livelihoods, and enhance the resilience of rural communities in
disaster-prone areas.

### Core Terminology and Management Phases

Understanding the fundamental terminology and phases of disaster
management is essential for interpreting the scope and objectives of
agricultural disaster response. In this context, the term disaster
refers to a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or
system, caused by natural or human-induced hazards, which results in
widespread human, material, economic, or environmental losses that
exceed the affected community's ability to cope using its own resources.
Within the agricultural domain, disasters often manifest as extreme
weather events, pest infestations, or environmental stressors that
severely impair crop production, livestock systems, and rural
livelihoods.

Closely related to this concept are the terms damage, loss, and impact,
which, while sometimes used interchangeably, carry distinct meanings in
disaster evaluations and response. Damage typically refers to the direct
physical harm to agricultural assets, such as destroyed crops, submerged
farmland, or collapsed storage facilities. Loss, in contrast,
encompasses the broader economic and productivity-related consequences
that result from this damage, such as reduced harvest volumes, lower
incomes, or increased food prices. Impact is a more comprehensive term
that captures both tangible and intangible effects of the disaster,
including disruptions to food supply chains, livelihood insecurity, and
long-term environmental degradation.

Within the broader disaster management cycle, which includes mitigation,
preparedness, response, and recovery, the response phase plays a pivotal
role in minimizing immediate losses and safeguarding lives and assets.
This phase involves rapid evaluations of disaster impacts, mobilization
of emergency resources, provision of aid (e.g., food, water,
agricultural inputs), and temporary restoration of agricultural
functions. Unlike mitigation and preparedness, which are proactive in
nature, or recovery, which is focused on long-term rebuilding, the
response phase is characterized by urgency and short-term action.
Nevertheless, decisions made during this phase---such as how to allocate
aid or prioritize interventions---can have lasting effects on the
trajectory of recovery and resilience-building.

By establishing a clear conceptual understanding of these terms and the
function of the response phase, this chapter provides a necessary
foundation for the technical discussions in subsequent sections,
particularly those involving the application of remote sensing in
disaster evaluations and agricultural response planning.

## Remote Sensing Technologies and Methods for Disaster Response

Remote sensing has become a vital tool in modern agricultural disaster
response, offering timely, scalable, and cost-effective means to
observe, analyze, and assess natural hazards and their impacts on
agricultural systems. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of
the key technologies, platforms, and analytical methods commonly applied
in remote sensing for disaster-related agricultural statistics. Emphasis
is placed on monitoring crop conditions, land cover changes, water
availability, and post-disaster recovery across farming landscapes.

We first introduce the principal remote sensing technologies used in
agricultural disaster contexts, including optical sensors, radar
systems, thermal infrared imaging, and multispectral and hyperspectral
instruments --- each contributing unique capabilities for detecting
changes in vegetation health, soil moisture, surface water, and thermal
anomalies affecting agricultural areas.

The next section outlines widely utilized satellite and UAV platforms such as
Sentinel-1/2, Landsat series, MODIS, high-resolution commercial
satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), highlighting their
roles in capturing spatial and temporal variations in agricultural
landscapes before, during, and after disaster events.

Finally, we focus on typical remote sensing methods and thematic
indicators relevant to agricultural disaster monitoring. These include
vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) for detecting crop stress and
recovery, water body and flood mapping techniques (e.g., NDWI, SAR
backscatter) for assessing water availability and inundation of
croplands, drought monitoring approaches integrating thermal infrared
and precipitation data, and change detection methods based on pre- and
post-event image comparison and time-series analysis. The chapter also
reviews the application of these technologies in monitoring diverse
agricultural disaster types such as droughts, floods, pest infestations,
storms, and wildfires.

### Overview of major remote sensing technologies

Remote sensing technologies encompass a wide array of sensor systems
designed to capture critical environmental information for agricultural
disaster evaluations. Optical sensors, which detect reflected sunlight
in the visible and near-infrared spectra, are extensively used for
monitoring land cover, crop vigor, and surface water dynamics. Radar
systems, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), operate
independently of daylight and atmospheric conditions, providing
invaluable data for mapping floods, soil moisture variations, and storm
damage in agricultural regions.

Thermal infrared sensors measure emitted surface heat, supporting
wildfire detection, drought monitoring, and evapotranspiration
evaluations. Multispectral and hyperspectral instruments further enhance
agricultural disaster analysis by discriminating between crop types,
stress levels, and soil conditions. Multispectral sensors acquire data
across several broad spectral bands, while hyperspectral sensors capture
hundreds of narrow, contiguous bands, enabling detailed analysis of
subtle changes in vegetation health, soil composition, and surface water
quality. Integrating these technologies improves the timeliness and
accuracy of agricultural disaster response and statistical reporting.

### Common Satellite and UAV Platforms

A variety of satellite and UAV platforms serve as primary carriers for
remote sensing sensors in agricultural disaster response. The common
technical parameters of satellite and UAV platforms and their
applications in agricultural disasters are shown in Table 2. Satellite
missions such as the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, operated by the European
Space Agency, provide free, high-frequency radar and optical imagery,
supporting flood mapping, crop monitoring, and damage evaluations. The
Landsat series, with its long historical archive and moderate-resolution
multispectral data, remains a valuable source for evaluating land use
changes and post-disaster agricultural recovery.

: Satellite and UAV technologies for disaster response {#tbl-sat-uav-disasters}


NASA's MODIS sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites offer daily
global observations, essential for tracking large-scale phenomena such
as droughts, dust storms, and wildfire impacts on agricultural areas.
High-resolution commercial satellites, including WorldView, Pleiades,
and GeoEye, supply sub-meter imagery for detailed damage evaluations in
rural and peri-urban farming zones. UAVs, equipped with optical,
thermal, or multispectral sensors, have emerged as highly flexible tools
capable of acquiring very high-resolution data over targeted
agricultural sites, providing rapid situational awareness for crop
damage evaluations, yield loss estimation, and resource planning.

## Typical Remote Sensing Methods and Indicators

To interpret remote sensing data effectively in agricultural disaster
response, a suite of analytical methods and thematic indicators has been
developed. Vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are widely
employed to monitor crop health, biomass productivity, and ecological
recovery following droughts, floods, fires, and pest outbreaks.

For surface water and flood detection, indices like the Normalized
Difference Water Index (NDWI) and SAR backscatter coefficients reliably
delineate inundated croplands and assess water-related impacts on
agricultural infrastructure. Drought monitoring integrates thermal
infrared data to detect surface temperature anomalies and
evapotranspiration patterns, combined with precipitation records and
soil moisture estimates to assess water stress and forecast crop yield
losses.

Change detection techniques are crucial for disaster impact evaluations,
enabling comparisons of pre- and post-event imagery to quantify damaged
cropland, land cover transitions, and recovery dynamics. Methods range
from simple image differencing and index thresholding to advanced
time-series analyses and machine learning-based classification,
supporting the rapid identification of affected agricultural areas and
informing emergency management decisions, food security evaluations, and
agricultural statistical reporting.

## Workflow and Data Integration for Agricultural Disaster Response

This section outlines the comprehensive workflow and data integration
framework designed to support agricultural disaster response efforts. As
illustrated in @fig-image3-disaster, it begins with Baseline Mapping and
Preparedness, which involves establishing detailed, up-to-date
agricultural and environmental datasets to serve as reference points
before disasters occur. Next, it addresses Real-Time Monitoring,
focusing on the use of remote sensing, field data, and digital tools to
detect and track disaster events as they unfold. Following this,
Post-Disaster Loss Evaluations and Analysis covers methods for
evaluating the extent of damage, estimating losses, and understanding
the broader impacts on agricultural systems. Finally, Reporting and
Decision Support describes how processed data and analyses are
translated into actionable reports and decision-making tools to guide
timely and effective response strategies. Together, these components
form an integrated workflow for enhancing resilience and operational
efficiency in agricultural disaster management.

## Baseline Mapping and Preparedness

Baseline mapping and preparedness form the foundation for effective
agricultural disaster response by providing comprehensive pre-disaster
datasets. The types and sources of the basic datasets are shown in Table
3, this phase involves the systematic collection, integration, and
analysis of high-resolution agricultural and environmental data,
including crop types, soil properties, water resources, and historical
disaster records. Remote sensing technologies such as satellite imagery
and LiDAR generate detailed spatial maps, which are validated through
ground surveys to ensure accuracy.

: Types and sources of basic datasets {#tbl-data-disasters}

Beyond data collection, this stage focuses on developing early warning
systems and contingency plans. By integrating climate models with
historical disaster patterns, stakeholders can identify vulnerable areas
and implement preventive strategies like crop diversification and water
management. Regular updates to datasets, along with the incorporation of
climate change projections, strengthen the overall resilience of
agricultural systems.

Additionally, this phase emphasizes the establishment of standardized
protocols for data collection, storage, and sharing to ensure
consistency and interoperability. Cloud-based platforms and metadata
standards enable secure, real-time data exchange among farmers,
researchers, and policymakers, fostering collaboration and preparedness
for coordinated disaster response efforts.

### Real-Time Monitoring

Real-time monitoring is essential for detecting and tracking
agricultural disasters as they occur. The corresponding technical
parameters for real-time detection are shown in Table 4, this stage
leverages advanced remote sensing technologies, including synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imaging, to collect timely data
on environmental parameters such as temperature, precipitation, and
vegetation health. These remote observations are complemented by
field-based sensors and UAV imagery to provide localized,
high-resolution insights.

Centralized monitoring platforms integrate these diverse data streams,
enabling the automated detection of anomalies---like abrupt shifts in
vegetation indices or moisture levels---that signal the onset of
droughts, floods, or pest outbreaks. Machine learning models analyze
these patterns, predict potential disaster developments, and support the
dissemination of early warnings to farmers and decision-makers through
mobile apps and SMS alerts.

This phase also highlights the importance of continuous data validation
and system calibration to maintain accuracy and reliability. Robust
communication networks and data-sharing protocols ensure that real-time
monitoring outputs are actionable, timely, and effectively distributed
across stakeholders, enhancing the agricultural system's capacity to
respond to rapidly evolving disaster scenarios.

### Post-Disaster Loss Evaluations and Analysis:

Post-disaster loss evaluations and analysis quantify damage and evaluate
the broader impacts of disasters on agricultural systems. By integrating
pre-disaster baseline data with post-event observations from remote
sensing, UAV surveys, and field reports, affected areas are mapped and
crop losses are estimated using geospatial techniques like change
detection and vegetation index analysis. As shown in @fig-image4-disaster, the
2023--2024 drought monitoring NDVI time series comparison example for
central Hubei clearly illustrates the significant changes in vegetation
coverage in the affected areas before and after the disaster.

Economic evaluations model the financial consequences of disasters on
farmers and agricultural markets, while social impact evaluations gauge
effects on livelihoods and food security. Multi-source data fusion
enhances the accuracy of these evaluations, combining satellite imagery
with field data to validate crop condition and yield losses. Machine
learning models further assist in forecasting long-term impacts on
agricultural productivity and resilience.

This phase also focuses on extracting lessons learned and identifying
best practices to improve future disaster response. Participatory
approaches engage local communities in the evaluations process, ensuring
that recovery strategies are data-driven yet context-sensitive. Insights
from this analysis inform adaptive management frameworks and guide
resilience-building policies within agricultural systems.

## Reporting and Decision Support

The final stage translates processed data and analyses into clear,
actionable outputs for decision-makers. Comprehensive reports summarize
disaster impacts, crop loss estimates, and recommended response
measures, presented through intuitive visualizations such as maps,
charts, and dashboards to facilitate rapid understanding.

Decision support systems (DSS) integrate multi-source data---from remote
sensing to economic models---to provide real-time, evidence-based
recommendations for emergency response, resource allocation, and
recovery planning. These systems help prioritize interventions, such as
distributing inputs to severely affected areas or targeting pest control
based on geospatial analysis. Regular briefings, workshops, and
knowledge-sharing sessions engage farmers, policymakers, and
international partners to ensure informed, coordinated responses.

Finally, this stage reinforces continuous feedback loops to evaluate the
effectiveness of disaster response strategies. Performance metrics and
impact evaluations track recovery outcomes, while iterative improvements
enhance future preparedness and operational efficiency. By merging
data-driven insights with local expertise, reporting and decision
support strengthen the resilience of agricultural systems in the face of
recurring disasters.
