## Outline

Earth Observation (EO) stands at a pivotal juncture in its capacity to transform agricultural statistics. For National Statistical Offices (NSOs) – our primary audience – this handbook arrives at a critical moment. The integration of EO into agricultural statistics is not just a technical opportunity; it is a policy imperative. As countries strive to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensure food security, and respond to climate volatility, the ability to generate timely, reliable, and spatially explicit agricultural data has become essential.

While satellite data availability has expanded dramatically—most notably through the Copernicus Sentinel missions, which now provide near-daily global coverage at 10–20m resolution (ESA, 2024)—the operational use of these resources by NSOs remains limited. This persistent gap is striking, given the extensive scientific literature showcasing advanced techniques for land cover and crop type mapping. As Nakalembe et al. (2024) observe, “less than 30% of NSOs in developing economies routinely incorporate EO into crop reporting”—a stark mismatch between EO's potential and its implementation.
The reasons for this gap are multifaceted. First, data abundance itself introduces complexity. Platforms like the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and Digital Earth Africa offer petabyte-scale Analysis-Ready Data (ARD), but turning this into actionable agricultural statistics requires high-performance computing and structured processing chains. While countries such as Poland and Brazil have established national HPC ecosystems to process continental-scale EO data cubes (Łączyński et al., 2024), many NSOs lack comparable resources.

Second, research-grade EO solutions often falter in operational settings. Deep learning models may achieve over 90% accuracy under experimental conditions (Wang et al., 2024), but their deployment in national programs is challenged by inconsistent training data, cloud interference, and the need to reconcile statistical rigor with time-sensitive reporting cycles [deSimone2025]. Operational maturity demands more than algorithmic innovation—it requires adaptation, institutional readiness, and governance.
To meet these challenges, the global EO community has coalesced around building robust toolchains. ESA’s Sen4Stat platform—built on GDAL and incorporating Orfeo components—offers a reproducible pipeline for crop mapping and yield forecasting [@Defourny2019]. Similarly, Brazil’s SITS R package enables scalable time-series classification and is now deployed in Chile’s national land accounts [deSimone2025]. But beyond individual tools, a more integrated coordination framework is emerging.

At the center of this effort is GEOGLAM (Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring)—a collaborative initiative uniting the world’s leading programs in crop monitoring. GEOGLAM orchestrates a diverse set of efforts including Sen4Stat, NASA Harvest, JRC, CropWatch, EOSTAT, CropMonitor, AMIS, and JECAM. These programs collectively advance the capacity of countries to monitor agricultural production through shared data infrastructures, methodological standardization, and transparency. Importantly, GEOGLAM is increasingly focused on strengthening the statistical rigor of crop monitoring—aligning more closely with NSO requirements for official area and yield estimation. This handbook complements that ambition, offering tools, case studies, and software that help bridge EO-based crop monitoring with statistical reporting.
In parallel, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has played a critical role in enabling country-level capacity development. The UN Task Team on Earth Observations for Agricultural Statistics, established under the UN Committee of Experts on Big Data and Data Science and the UN Expert Group on Rural, Agricultural and Food Security Statistics, has driven collective progress in EO adoption by NSOs. Through documented contributions to the UN Statistical Commission, the Task Team has promoted South–South cooperation, capacity building, and joint projects across regions. Recently, it has deepened collaboration with the UN Global Platform, particularly through increased engagement with the UN Big Data Regional Hubs. In this context, the Global Hub for Big Data in China has taken a leading role in supporting this handbook initiative as a key deliverable for operationalizing EO within national statistical systems (FAO, 2025).
Accuracy, in this context, is non-negotiable. As shown by [Olofsson202], classification errors above 15% can lead to over 20% distortion in area statistics—errors that compromise national reporting and policy formulation. This handbook addresses these issues across the full statistical workflow: from building ARD data cubes to implementing bias-corrected estimators, quantifying uncertainty, and generating statistically valid crop area measures. Real-world deployments, such as Chile’s 30m-resolution crop maps and Indonesia’s use of active learning to cut labeling costs by 40% while maintaining 90% detection accuracy, demonstrate the feasibility of integrating EO into official systems.

What sets this handbook apart is its emphasis on reproducibility and reusability. Each chapter includes executable R and Python scripts that allow NSOs to directly implement the methods discussed. Whether using Sen4Stat’s GDAL workflows, SITS classifiers, NASA Harvest’s ARYA crop yield model [@Becker-Reshef2023], or PRESTO, a transformer-based model for time-series feature extraction [@Tseng2024], the focus is on transparency and adaptability. These are not theoretical tools—they are field-tested systems embedded in national workflows.

As the EO landscape evolves, so too must national strategies. In 2025, NASA announced the discontinuation of Landsat Next—once intended to continue the legacy of the world’s longest-running EO mission. This unexpected restructuring highlights the fragility of EO continuity and the urgent need for risk mitigation. To this end, the handbook includes a dedicated chapter to help NSOs develop resilient, multi-source EO strategies that reduce dependency on any single mission or platform.

Fortunately, efforts are underway to secure long-term EO data availability. The European Space Agency, through its [Sentinel Expansion and Copernicus Next Generation missions](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu), is investing in hyperspectral, L-band radar, and thermal infrared sensors designed to ensure continuity and enhance capacity. These investments, aligned with GEOGLAM’s coordination, provide a sustainable pathway for countries to anchor EO in their statistical systems.

The journey from satellite pixels to policy-relevant statistics is complex—but no longer aspirational. With 15 real-world use cases, field-tested methodologies, and ready-to-use software, this handbook aims to help NSOs move from exploration to execution, and from data collection to decision-making.
