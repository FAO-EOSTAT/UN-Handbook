## Outline

In this chapter we will share a crop classification exercise designed to teach, step by step, a simple classification process for didactic purposes, that could be replicated by any user. For this exercise we are using harmonized Landsat and Sentinel 2 images and Sentinel 1 radar images, as well as Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms, such as TPOT libraries and Auto Sklearn. Process algorithms are programmed in Python and Conda in a Sandbox environment.
