## Outline

This chapter describes machine learning methods for classifying individual remote sensing images and image time series. The chapter considers three kinds of algorithms:
•	Machine learning algorithms that do not explicitly consider the spatial and temporal structure of the time series. These methods include random forests, support vector machine and extreme gradient boosting. 
•	Deep learning methods which consider temporal relations between observed values in a time series. This class of models includes 1D convolutional neural networks and temporal attention-based encoders. 
•	Semantic segmentation methods based on U-net paradigms and multidimensional 2D convolution.
