## Outline

This chapter provides a general introduction to remote sensing imagery. The authors discuss different types of remote sensing satellites  (optical, SAR,  hyperspectral) and include examples of satellite constellations (e.g, Landsat,  Copernicus, CHEOS). The chapter describes the main characteristics of various Earth observation satellites. For a description of how to access satellites from the Copernicus and Landsat programmes, please refer to chapter on [Earth Observation Data Sources](https://fao-eostat.github.io/UN-Handbook/th_data_sources.html).

## Introduction of remote sensing imagery

Remote sensing imagery refers to data collected by sensors mounted on satellite platforms, used to observe and analyze the Earth's surface and its atmosphere from a distance. These images capture information about various phenomena and play an important role in the study of the surface of the Earth. These images are usually comprised of multiple bands and important for the study of agriculture statistics, land cover/land use and other different tasks. In agriculture statistics, remote sensing applications are based on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with soil or plant material. The advantage of remote sensing in agriculture is its ability to provide detailed information about crop characteristics. For example, spectral, textural, phenological features can be used to create a map showing plant distribution. Indicators such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), biomass, crop density can be used to assess vegetation growth.

Remote sensing imagery is broadly classified into two main categories based on the type of sensors used: optical remote sensing imagery and radar remote sensing imagery. Optical sensors (e.g., cameras or imaging spectrometers) primarily capture electromagnetic radiation in spectral bands such as visible light, near-infrared, or short-wave infrared. Radar remote sensing imagery, especially in the context of Earth observation, is predominantly associated with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).

: Spectral bands used in remote sensing {#tbl-bands}

Optical remote sensing imagery makes use of visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared sensors (passive optical sensors) to form images of the Earth's surface by receiving the solar radiation reflected from targets on the ground. Ground objects reflect and absorb radiation differently at each wavelength. Thus, the targets can be distinguished by their spectral reflectance signatures in the remote sensing imagery. Vegetation has a unique spectral signature. This signature enables it to be distinguished readily from other types of land cover in an optical/near-infrared image. For specific crops, due to their spectral and phenological characteristics, the combination of phenological period information with multi-temporal remote sensing imagery can be used to explore a crop area and its status in the growing season.

Radar satellites emit its own microwave signals and analyze the returning echoes. This capability allows radar to penetrate clouds, haze, and even vegetation canopies, providing data regardless of daylight or weather conditions.

## Copernicus Programme

The Copernicus Programme is headed by the European Commission in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) that implements a constellation of satellites called Sentinels. These satellites include all-weather radar images from Sentinel-1A and 1B, high-resolution optical images from Sentinel-2A and 2B, ocean and land data suitable for environmental and climate monitoring from Sentinel-3, as well as air quality data from Sentinel-5P. 

### Sentinel-1 mission

The Sentinel-1 mission, operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), consists of a constellation of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites designed to provide continuous, all-weather, day-and-night Earth observation capabilities. Operating at a central frequency of approximately 5.405 GHz, corresponding to a wavelength of 5.6 cm, the system offers multiple polarization configurations, including single-polarization modes (HH or VV) and dual-polarization modes (HH+HV or VV+VH). These options allow for flexibility in addressing diverse application requirements, ranging from high-resolution terrestrial monitoring to large-area maritime surveillance.

Sentinel-1 supports four primary imaging modes, each optimized to balance spatial resolution, swath width, and revisit frequency according to the observational context. The Stripmap (SM) mode provides a swath width of approximately 80 km at a spatial resolution of about 5 m in both range and azimuth directions, making it suitable for applications demanding fine spatial detail over relatively narrow swaths, such as scientific investigations and precision mapping. The Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, which constitutes the default operational mode over land, achieves a swath width of roughly 250 km and a spatial resolution of about 5 m (range) by 20 m (azimuth). This mode employs the Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) technique, enabling high interferometric coherence and reduced azimuth scalloping, thereby supporting deformation monitoring, land-cover mapping, and interferometric SAR (InSAR) applications.

The Extra-Wide Swath (EW) mode, predominantly employed for maritime and cryospheric applications, covers a swath of approximately 400 km with a spatial resolution of 20 m (range) by 40 m (azimuth). Its wide coverage facilitates large-scale change detection, sea-ice monitoring, and vessel tracking. Finally, the Wave (WV) mode acquires small image segments, or imagettes, of 20 km swath width at intervals of approximately 100 km along the satellite ground track, with a spatial resolution of about 5 m × 5 m. This mode is specifically designed for the retrieval of ocean wave spectra and sea state parameters.

In summary, the Sentinel-1 mission offers a set of operational modes that balance resolution and coverage to meet the diverse observational requirements of land, ocean, and ice monitoring. Its flexible polarization schemes and consistent revisit capabilities make it a cornerstone in global SAR-based Earth observation programs.

### Sentinel-2 mission

The Sentinel-2 mission, developed under the European Union’s Copernicus Programme and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), consists of a constellation of polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-2A (launched in June 2015), Sentinel-2B (launched in March 2017), and Sentinel-2C (launched in September 2024). The Sentinel-2 satellites are equipped with the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), a push-broom imaging sensor that acquires data in 13 discrete spectral bands spanning the visible, near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The MSI is designed to provide high spatial resolution (10 m, 20 m, or 60 m depending on the spectral band) over a swath width of 290 km, enabling systematic coverage of terrestrial and coastal ecosystems.

The mission supports a broad range of applications, including vegetation monitoring, agricultural management, forestry assessment, inland and coastal water quality mapping, disaster risk reduction, and land use/land cover classification. The Sentinel-2 satellites are the first civil optical Earth observation mission of its kind to include three bands in the 'red edge', which provides key information on the vegetation state. Sentinel-2 satellite will be able to see very early changes in plant health due to its high temporal, spatial resolution, and 3 red edge bands. This is particularly useful for the end-users and policymakers for agriculture applications and to detect early signs of food shortages in different places.

## Final remarks

Multi-source satellite remote sensing facilitates coordinated global observation through orbital synergy, while the integration of optical imagery and SAR datasets enables multisensor data collection across heterogeneous meteorological regimes. This synergistic complementarity between spectral resolution and all-weather capability holds significant implications for enhancing the spatiotemporal continuity and operational robustness of agricultural statistical monitoring systems.
